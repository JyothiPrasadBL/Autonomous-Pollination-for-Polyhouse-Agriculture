🌱 Autonomous Pollination for Polyhouse Agriculture
📌 Overview

Autonomous Pollination for Polyhouse Agriculture is a smart, AI-guided system designed to automate the pollination process in controlled and indoor farming environments. The project aims to improve crop productivity while reducing human effort and dependency on traditional farming methods.

🎯 Problem Statement

Limited space, time constraints, and lack of agricultural expertise prevent many individuals from practicing efficient farming, especially in urban and controlled environments. Manual pollination methods are time-consuming and inefficient, creating a need for an automated, intelligent solution.

💡 Proposed Solution

This project introduces an autonomous pollination system that:

Automates pollination in polyhouse and indoor farming setups

Uses intelligent control mechanisms for efficient operation

Minimizes manual intervention

Supports sustainable and smart agriculture practices

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Artificial Intelligence (concepts)

IoT and Sensors

Automation / Embedded Systems

🚀 Key Features

Autonomous pollination mechanism

User-friendly and modular design

Suitable for indoor and controlled agriculture

Enhances efficiency and crop sustainability
